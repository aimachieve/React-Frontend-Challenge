How to use the project 🏹

    Folder structure
    ===============
    #pages
    The biggest change to this folder structure is the addition of    
    the pages folder. This folder should contain one folder for each 
    page in your application.  

    This separation of page specific code from your more general 
    global code is the biggest benefit of this system over the simple 
    folder structure. It is easier to see what your application is 
    doing when all the relevant code is collocated in a single folder.

    #components
    These subfolders are really useful since they help keep your 
    components organized into different sections instead of just being 
    one massive blob of components. In our project we have a ui folder 
    which contains all our UI components like buttons, reviews, cards, 
    etc. We also have a form folder for form specific controls like 
    checkboxes, inputs, date pickers that we will be using in the  
    future.

    #hooks
    Instead of storing every hook in your application it will only 
    store the global hooks that are used across multiple pages. This 
    is because all page specific hooks are stored in the pages folder.

    #assets
    The assets folder contains all images, css files, font files, etc. 
    for your project. Pretty much anything that isn't code related 
    will be stored in this folder.


    #data
    The data folder is similar to the assets folder, but this is for 
    storing our data assets such as JSON files that contain 
    information used in our code (store items, theme information, etc)
    . This folder can also store a file that contains global constant 
    variables. This is useful when you have lots of constants you use 
    across your application, such as environment variables.

    #utils
    The final new folder is the utils folder. This folder is for 
    storing all utility functions such as formatters. This is a pretty 
    straightforward folder and all the files in this folder should 
    likewise be straightforward. I generally like to only store pure  
    JavaScript functions in this folder since if a utility function 
    has side effects then it is most likely not just a simple utility 
    function. 
    Obviously I put pure JavaScript functions there in our project 
    which implement image slide effect.

What is good? 😎

    The biggest benefit to this new system is that all your files have 
    their own folder. The actual root src folder should have almost no 
    files in it.

    Another huge benefit is that your files are now collocated based 
    on the page they are used in. This is good since generally as a 
    project grows it is more and more important to have files that are 
    used together stored together since it makes understanding, 
    writing, and reading code easier as it reduces the amount of 
    global code stored in your general components, hooks, etc. folders.
